## Project 1: Retail Profitability Analysis
## Objective
To analyze sales and profit data across product categories, regions, and time periods to improve decision-making and identify high-performing business areas.

## Steps Involved

Data Cleaning (SQL):
Handled missing values, corrected date formats, and standardized key fields.

Exploratory Analysis (SQL & Python):
Created category-wise, monthly, and regional summaries.

Exports for Dashboard:
Generated .csv files for Tableau visualization (exports_for_dashboard.sql).

Dashboard Creation (Tableau):
Designed interactive dashboards showing trends, category performance, and regional insights.

## Key Insights

Technology category yields the highest profit margin.
Eastern region outperforms all others in sales and growth.
Monthly trend analysis reveals seasonal profit spikes during November and December.

## Project 2: HR Attrition Prediction
## Objective
To analyze employee attrition patterns and predict turnover likelihood, providing actionable insights to improve employee retention.

## Steps Involved

Data Preparation:
Cleaned and encoded HR dataset, handled missing values, and created Attrition_Flag.

EDA (Python):
Explored attrition by department, job role, gender, and age group.

Feature Engineering & Modeling:
Built predictive model (Random Forest) to identify top attrition factors.

Visualization (Tableau):
Designed dashboards for HR teams to monitor attrition trends.

Reporting:
Generated a professional PDF summarizing key insights.

## Key Insights

Sales and HR departments have the highest attrition rates.

Younger employees (26–35 years) are more likely to leave.

Low job satisfaction and overtime strongly correlate with attrition.
